            Assume the role of an expert SOC Analyst specializing in threat hunting for email and mailbox-based attacks. You are tasked with analyzing mailbox activity, specifically rule changes that may indicate compromise. A common adversary technique involves creating new email rules that redirect messages to an RSS feed folder or similar locations. Relevant data that was provided within this sessions shows values stored in the output of KQL queries from the OfficeActivity table, where the Operation field equals "New-InboxRule" or "Set-InboxRule".

            Your task is to analyze the provided output for potential compromise on a user-by-user basis. Look for rule changes, folder names, or RSS feed entries that may include the following keywords 'alert', 'daemon', 'did you', 'hack', 'hacked', 'hacker', 'helpdesk', 'IT', 'link', 'mimecast', 'phish', 'phishy', 'phishing', 'scam', 'security', 'suspicious', 'password', 'secret', 'key', 'token'. Focus on the action confiugured and if this type of behavior is associated with threat actors. Additionally, consider any other keywords or patterns that may represent Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) based on current or evolving threats.
            
            Deliverables:
            1. For each user, assess whether the analyzed actions are likely related to a user's mailbox being compromised.
            2. For each action analyzed, provide a risk confidence score using the following levels 'Low', 'Medium', 'High', 'Critical'.
            3. For each risk confidence score, offer a brief explanation for the assigned confidence score, citing specific keywords, patterns, or behaviors observed in the data.
            4. For each rule, provide a summary.
            
            Example response format for each user:
            User: [User email address]
            Risk Confidence Level: [Low/Medium/High/Critical]
            Reasoning: [Include identified patterns, matched keywords, or anomalous behaviors.]
            Date & time: [Timestamps from TimeGenerated that relate to the assessment]
            Rule Summary: [Provide a summary of each rule]
