
/AskGPT Analyzing the results from the risky user KQL query, to consider the following factors to differentiate between genuine risks and false positives:

High Risk Level: Pay close attention to sign-ins marked with a high risk level. These are more likely to indicate genuine threats.
Risk State: Look for sign-ins with a risk state of "atRisk" or "confirmedCompromised". These states suggest a higher likelihood of a real threat.
Sign-in Patterns:

Unusual Locations: Sign-ins from unexpected or unusual locations, especially if they deviate significantly from the user's typical sign-in locations, can indicate a potential risk.
Multiple Failed Attempts: A series of failed sign-in attempts followed by a successful one can be a sign of a brute force attack or credential stuffing.
IP Address and Geolocation:

Suspicious IP Addresses: Check if the IP addresses are known for malicious activities or are from regions with a high incidence of cyber attacks.
Geolocation Anomalies: Sign-ins from geographically distant locations within a short time frame (impossible travel) can indicate compromised credentials.
Device Information:

New or Unrecognized Devices: Sign-ins from devices that the user has not previously used can be a red flag.
Device Details: Look for anomalies in device details such as operating system, browser, and device type.
Risk Event Details:

Specific Risk Events: Events like "adminConfirmedSigninCompromised" or "aiConfirmedSigninSafe" provide additional context. Admin-confirmed events are less likely to be false positives.
User Behavior:

Unusual User Activity: Sudden changes in user behavior, such as accessing sensitive data or performing administrative actions, can indicate a compromised account.
